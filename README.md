# Valve insight - Switching analysis

This project showcases key algorithms from the Valve Insight portfolio, focused on analyzing valve switching behavior.

**Included Algorithms**
- Switching Fault Detection
- Switching Duration Detection

The sample data included in this repository was recorded using the Valve Insight Evaluation Kit. For comparison, we also provide example curves captured using high-end laboratory instrumentation.

If you have specific requirements or are interested in a tailored solution, please don’t hesitate to contact us.

### Getting Started

The algorithms are available in both Python and C.

**Python**
A Jupyter Notebook is included to demonstrate the Python algorithms and visualize their results.
You can run the notebook using the provided Dockerfile or in any local Jupyter environment.

**C**
The C implementations are delivered as a [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org) project, complete with unit tests for verification and validation.
